- Class MeshViewer to visualzie triangulated mesh and velocities, forces
- Best to use mayavi -> plot3D.mlabMeshViewer.py. But I have problems to install mayavi under windows.
  Hence there is matplotlib realisation mplMeshViewer. 
- matplotlib version - right now no arrows implemented and can't set aspect ratio.
