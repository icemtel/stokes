Use `run_parallel` function to parallelize a job.
Important:
- Threads have access to the same memory.
  - Must be careful that they don't overwrite some shared object.
  - Can cause a slowdown when reading shared memory.
  - The most natural way to avoid these problems - use `multiprocessing` instead of `threading` - requires more work.
- One way to save results is to save them to a file, e.g. `sp.savetxt()`, a separate file for each input
- Another way - save results to a dictionary; this dictionary will be shared by all threads.
  That's a lazy way, but normally works.

See an example in the end of the file.

    Function will be executed in parallel,
    taking each time arguments from list_of_args, and key-arguments from list_of_kwargs
    The functions exits only after each thread is finished.
    Limitations:
        (1) If there is one argument, it has to be wrapped in a list, e.g.
          [[1],[2],[3],..] instead of [1,2,3,4..]
        (2) Works with lists; not tested with generators?
